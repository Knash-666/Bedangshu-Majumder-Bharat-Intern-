## Overview

The "House Price Prediction" project is a Python-based application that utilizes TensorFlow for machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict house prices for upcoming years based on historical data. The model is compiled using Mean Squared Error as the loss function.

## Data Source

The project uses data from the `house.csv` file, where the 'TIME' (year) and 'Value' (price at that year) are extracted using the pandas library.

## Dependencies

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (Pyplot)
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn (Min Max Scaler)
